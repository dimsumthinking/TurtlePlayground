# TurtlePlayground
Swift playground using Logo-like commands

A few preliminary notes:

* This playground requires the new playground format and features released in Xcode 6.3. This version requires Yosemite.
* From time to time playgrounds can crash or seem to disappear from time to time. The current fix suggested by Apple is to show the package contents of the playground and delete the workspace.
* Type the word "turtle" in the playground. You should see "Turtle" on the right. Mouse over it and you will see the quick look icon and the value history. Click on the value history. You should see a rectangle with a turtle's head (>) in the middle.
* Make the turtle move by typing in "forward()". Make the turtle turn by typing in "right()".
* Create routines and your own functions.
* I'm experimenting with custom operators. We can draw a square like this:
4◊ {                 // this character is shift - option - v

     100»            // this character is shift - option - \

     90¬             // this character is shift - l

}

I am working on a book that will serve as a tutorial using this playground. It will be available soon.
