# TurtlePlayground
Swift playground using Logo-like commands

A few preliminary notes:

* This playground requires the new playground format and features released in Xcode 7 and Swift 2. This version requires Yosemite.
* From time to time playgrounds can crash or seem to disappear from time to time. The current fix suggested by Apple is to show the package contents of the playground and delete the workspace.
* Type  "turtle" in the playground. You should see "Turtle_Sources.Turtle" on the right. Mouse over it and you will see the quick look icon and the show value icon. Click on the show value icon. You should see a rectangle with a turtle in the middle. Enlarge the box if you like.
* Make the turtle move by typing in "forward()". Make the turtle turn by typing in "right()".
* Create routines and your own functions.

I am working on a book that will serve as a tutorial using this playground. It will be available soon.
