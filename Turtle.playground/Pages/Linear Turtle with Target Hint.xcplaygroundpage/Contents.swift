### Linear Turtle with Target Hints

[Back](Linear%20Turtle%20with%20Target)

---
* We begin with a turtle who knows how to move `forward()` and `back()`
* Can you steer the turtle to the target?
* To reset the target, remove everything from the playground including the turtle and type `resetTarget()`. Once the target is reset, remove `resetTarget()` and continue.
